# RawAccel Aim Assistant

RawAccel Aim Assistant is an AI-powered tool that measures your raw mouse accuracy, analyzes your movement metrics, and automatically recommends optimal RawAccel settings (gain, smoothness, accel angle, etc).  
It can apply configuration changes directly to RawAccel by updating the settings JSON and restarting the RawAccel process.
